[![Build status](https://build.anyways.eu/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:anyways_routing_ItineroTransitServer)/statusIcon)](https://build.anyways.eu/viewType.html?buildTypeId=anyways_routing_ItineroTransitServer)  

The Itinero-Transit-Server is a wrapper around the core library [itinero-transit](https://github.com/openplannerteam/itinero-transit). The core library offers routing over a public transport network, this small wrapper makes that available via HTTPS.

A demo is deployed [here](https://api.anyways.eu/transit/index.html).
The full documentation can be found [there as well](http://api.anyways.eu/transit/api.html)
